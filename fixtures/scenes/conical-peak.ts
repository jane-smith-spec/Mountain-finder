/**
 * SCENE 3 — CONICAL PEAK  (PLAN.md P6.1 "cone", P1.2's named analytic test)
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * MISSION.md: "A cone-shaped mathematical mountain has an exactly computable
 * horizon angle. If the pipeline can't get the cone right, no real photo will
 * save it." This is that cone.
 *
 * A right circular cone standing on an otherwise featureless plain at sea
 * level:
 *
 *     apex          1 500 m above sea level
 *     apex distance    10 000 m from the observer, on bearing 045°
 *     base radius       3 000 m  ⇒  flank slope 1500/3000 = 0.5 (26.565°)
 *     observer      ground 0 m, eye 2.0 m  ⇒  H_o = 2.0 m
 *
 * Terrain:  E(r) = 1500 · max(0, 1 − r/3000),  r = distance from the cone axis.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * DERIVATION 1 — APEX ALTITUDE ANGLE, BY HAND
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THIS SCENE ASSUMES R = 6 371 008.8 m (IUGG mean radius) and k = 0.13, and
 * scene-geometry.ts derives the effective radius symbolically from them:
 *
 *     R_eff = R/(1 − k) = 6 371 008.8 / 0.87 = 7 322 998.6207 m.
 *
 *     c = d² / (2 R_eff)
 *       = 10 000² / (2 × 7 322 998.6207)
 *       = 100 000 000 / 14 645 997.2414
 *       = 6.82780 m
 *
 *     apparent rise = E − H_o − c
 *                   = 1 500 − 2 − 6.82780
 *                   = 1 491.17220 m
 *
 *     tan α = 1 491.17220 / 10 000 = 0.14911722
 *
 *     α = atan(0.14911722)
 *       = x − x³/3 + x⁵/5 − x⁷/7 + x⁹/9 − …          (x = 0.14911722)
 *       = 0.14911722 − 0.00110526 + 0.00001475 − 0.00000023 + 0.00000000
 *       = 0.14802648 rad
 *       = 0.14802648 × 57.29577951
 *       = 8.481293°
 *
 * The exact sphere model (atan2 form, no small-angle step anywhere) gives
 * 8.479576°. The two disagree by 0.0017°, six times inside PLAN.md's 0.01°
 * tolerance — so this fixture does not force src/core into either convention.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * DERIVATION 2 — WHY THE APEX, AND NOT SOME POINT ON THE FLANK
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Along the ray through the cone axis, α(s) ≈ (E(s) − H_o)/s − s/(2R_eff), so
 * α rises all the way to the apex as long as the flank is steeper than the
 * sightline to it:
 *
 *     flank slope 0.500   >   tan α = 0.149      ✓ by a factor of 3.4
 *
 * Beyond the apex the flank descends and α falls. The apex is therefore the
 * unique maximum on that ray, and — since the cone is the only relief in the
 * scene — the unique maximum of the whole 360° profile.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * DERIVATION 3 — THE SKYLINE AWAY FROM THE CONE
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The cone subtends a half-angle of asin(3000/10000) = 17.458° about bearing
 * 045°, i.e. it occupies roughly 027.5°–062.5°. Everywhere else the skyline is
 * the bare plain, which is Scene 1's problem with h = 2.0 m:
 *
 *     dip = −√(2h/R_eff) = −√(4 / 7 322 998.6207)
 *         = −√(5.462242e-7)
 *         = −7.390697e-4 rad
 *         = −0.042346°
 *
 *     horizon range = √(2 R_eff h) = √(29 291 994.5) = 5 412.21 m
 *
 * Bearing 180° is asserted against that number. It is a second, much smaller
 * curvature test in the same scene: a pipeline that fudges curvature to make
 * the 8.48° apex come out right will not also land 0.042° on the nose.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * DERIVATION 4 — WHAT OCCLUDES THE APEX (the P1.5 nearer-terrain rule)
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * CORRECTED 2026-08-16. This fixture previously stated the apex's verdict as
 * `skylineAltitudeDeg = 8.479576, clearanceDeg = 0` — the apex measured against
 * ITSELF. That is the superseded pre-P1.5 rule ("a peak is visible iff it
 * clears the skyline at its bearing"), which twin-ridges.ts was migrated off
 * when P1.5 was fixed and this scene was missed. It passed only because the
 * self-consistency check is `visible === (clearance >= 0)` and `0 >= 0` holds.
 *
 * The rule is: a peak is occluded only by terrain NEARER to the observer than
 * the peak itself. Terrain behind it is backdrop and cannot hide it. So the
 * number a verdict must carry is the highest angle reached by terrain strictly
 * nearer than the apex — and the apex has terrain in front of it: its own
 * near flank.
 *
 * On that flank the angle climbs monotonically to the apex (DERIVATION 2:
 * flank slope 0.5 against tan α ≈ 0.15), so the maximum over samples strictly
 * nearer is the LAST SAMPLE BEFORE the apex, at 10 000 − 250 = 9 750 m. That
 * sample sits 250 m from the cone axis, so the analytic terrain gives it
 *
 *     E = 1 500 · (1 − 250/3 000) = 1 500 − 125 = 1 375 m   (exact)
 *
 *     c = 9 750² / (2 × 7 322 998.6207)
 *       = 95 062 500 / 14 645 997.2414
 *       = 6.490681 m
 *
 *     apparent rise = 1 375 − 2 − 6.490681 = 1 366.509319 m
 *
 *     tan α = 1 366.509319 / 9 750 = 0.140154802
 *
 *     α = x − x³/3 + x⁵/5 − x⁷/7 + x⁹/9 …            (x = 0.140154802)
 *       = 0.140154802 − 0.000917704 + 0.000010816 − 0.000000152 + 0.000000002
 *       = 0.139247764 rad
 *       = 0.139247764 × 57.29577951
 *       = 7.978309°
 *
 * The exact sphere model gives 7.976826° — the two differ by 0.0015°, the same
 * order as everywhere else in this directory, and 6× inside the 0.01°
 * tolerance. So:
 *
 *     apex          8.479576°   (exact model; 8.481293° drop model)
 *     its occluder  7.976826°   (exact model; 7.978309° drop model)
 *     clearance    +0.502750°   (exact model; +0.502983° drop model)
 *
 * ⇒ THE APEX IS VISIBLE, and by half a degree rather than by exactly nothing.
 * The old figure was 0.503° adrift — 50× this scene's own declared tolerance —
 * and, being pinned to zero clearance, it was a knife-edge that any sign error
 * could flip. The corrected margin is 50× the tolerance in the safe direction.
 *
 * Like twin-ridges.ts, this occluding angle depends on the declared 250 m
 * sampling: it is the angle of a specific sample, not of the continuum. A
 * finer grid would put the occluder closer to the apex and shrink the
 * clearance (in the limit of a continuous flank it tends to 0, which is why
 * the pre-P1.5 number looked plausible). `SAMPLING.rangeStepM` therefore
 * appears in the derivation, and the value below is obtained by scanning this
 * scene's OWN samples with this scene's OWN geometry kit — no pipeline code.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * SAMPLING NOTE
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 250 m range steps divide 10 000 m exactly, so bearing 045° has a sample
 * sitting precisely on the apex — the expectation is not softened by grid
 * interpolation. The plain-horizon expectation at 180° is stationary in range
 * (Scene 1's second-order argument), so its 162 m worst-case grid offset costs
 * under 2e-5°.
