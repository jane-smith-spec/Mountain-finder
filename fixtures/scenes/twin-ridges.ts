/**
 * SCENE 2 — TWIN RIDGES  (PLAN.md P6.1 "two ridges", P1.2 / P1.5 occlusion)
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The single most important thing this project has to get right is that a
 * distant peak can be HIGHER and still be HIDDEN, because a nearer, lower ridge
 * subtends a bigger angle. Height does not decide visibility; angle does. This
 * scene reduces that to two numbers you can compare on paper.
 *
 * Two ridges, both crossing the line of sight:
 *
 *     near ridge   crest  5 km away,   900 m
 *     far ridge    crest 20 km away,  2400 m  (variant A)  or  2000 m (variant B)
 *
 * Observer eye at exactly 500 m above sea level (ground 498.4 m + eye 1.6 m, so
 * the eye height is realistic AND the arithmetic below is clean).
 *
 * Between and beyond the ridges the terrain is a plain at the observer's own
 * ground elevation, 498.4 m — 1.6 m below the eye, hence always at a negative
 * angle and never a candidate for the skyline.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THE RIDGES ARE CONCENTRIC RINGS
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Each ridge is a circular ring centred on the observer, so the terrain depends
 * only on ground distance. That makes the analysis exact at EVERY bearing and
 * removes end effects — a finite straight ridge would have ends whose angles
 * are messy, and any disagreement there would be an artefact of the fixture
 * rather than a fact about the pipeline. "Along one bearing" is satisfied at
 * all 360 of them, and the extra symmetry gives P1.3's profile builder a strong
 * additional constraint: the profile must be flat in bearing.
 *
 * Ridge cross-section is triangular: the elevation rises linearly from the
 * plain to the crest over a half-width w, and falls the same way beyond.
 *
 *     ridge(d) = (crest − plain) · max(0, 1 − |d − d_crest| / w)
 *     terrain(d) = plain + max over both ridges of ridge(d)
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THE CREST IS THE MAXIMUM ANGLE ALONG THE RAY
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Along a ray, α(s) ≈ (E(s) − H_o)/s − s/(2R_eff). Differentiating,
 *
 *     dα/ds = E'(s)/s − (E(s) − H_o)/s² − 1/(2R_eff)
 *
 * On the near flank of a ridge this is positive — so α keeps climbing right up
 * to the crest — provided the flank is steeper than the sightline:
 *
 *     E'(s) > (E(s) − H_o)/s ≈ tan α
 *
 *   near ridge:  slope = 400 m / 1000 m = 0.400  vs  tan α ≈ 0.0797   ✓ 5.0×
 *   far ridge A: slope = 1900 m / 2000 m = 0.950 vs  tan α ≈ 0.0936   ✓ 10.1×
 *   far ridge B: slope = 1500 m / 2000 m = 0.750 vs  tan α ≈ 0.0736   ✓ 10.2×
 *
 * Past the crest E'(s) < 0 and α falls away. So the skyline candidate on each
 * ridge is its crest, and only its crest. No hidden fourth answer.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * DERIVATION — THE TWO ANGLES, BY HAND
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THIS SCENE ASSUMES: R = 6 371 008.8 m (IUGG mean radius) and k = 0.13.
 * The constant is never copied in as a decimal — scene-geometry.ts evaluates
 *
 *     R_eff = R / (1 − k) = 6 371 008.8 / 0.87 = 7 322 998.6207 m
 *
 * If src/core ever adopts a different R or k, the expectations below move and
 * this line is where a reviewer finds out. Curvature drop c = d²/(2 R_eff).
 *
 * ── NEAR RIDGE  (d = 5 000 m, E = 900 m, H_o = 500 m) ───────────────────────
 *     c₁ = 5 000² / (2 × 7 322 998.6207)
 *        = 25 000 000 / 14 645 997.2414
 *        = 1.70695 m
 *     apparent rise = 900 − 500 − 1.70695 = 398.29305 m
 *     tan α₁ = 398.29305 / 5 000 = 0.07965861
 *     α₁ = atan(0.07965861)
 *        = 0.07965861 − 0.07965861³/3 + 0.07965861⁵/5 − …
 *        = 0.07965861 − 0.00016849 + 0.00000064
 *        = 0.07949076 rad
 *        = 0.07949076 × 57.29577951
 *        = 4.554485°
 *
 * ── FAR RIDGE, VARIANT A  (d = 20 000 m, E = 2 400 m) ───────────────────────
 *     c₂ = 20 000² / 14 645 997.2414
 *        = 400 000 000 / 14 645 997.2414
 *        = 27.31122 m
 *     apparent rise = 2 400 − 500 − 27.31122 = 1 872.68878 m
 *     tan α₂ = 1 872.68878 / 20 000 = 0.09363444
 *     α₂ = 0.09363444 − 0.00027364 + 0.00000144 − 0.00000001
 *        = 0.09336223 rad
 *        = 5.349262°
 *
 *     α₂ (5.349262°) > α₁ (4.554485°)  by 0.794777°
 *     ⇒ THE FAR RIDGE FORMS THE SKYLINE. A peak on its crest is VISIBLE.
 *
 * ── FAR RIDGE, VARIANT B  (d = 20 000 m, E = 2 000 m) ───────────────────────
 *     c₂ unchanged = 27.31122 m
 *     apparent rise = 2 000 − 500 − 27.31122 = 1 472.68878 m
 *     tan α₂ = 1 472.68878 / 20 000 = 0.07363444
 *     α₂ = 0.07363444 − 0.00013308 + 0.00000043
 *        = 0.07350179 rad
 *        = 4.211342°
 *
 *     α₂ (4.211342°) < α₁ (4.554485°)  by 0.343143°
 *     ⇒ THE NEAR RIDGE FORMS THE SKYLINE. A peak on the far crest is HIDDEN,
 *       even though that crest stands 1 100 m HIGHER than the ridge hiding it.
 *
 * Both margins (0.79° and 0.34°) are 30–80× PLAN.md's 0.01° tolerance, so the
 * verdicts cannot flip on a modelling detail — only on a genuine mistake.
 *
 * The exact sphere model (`apparentAltitudeDeg`) gives 4.553926 / 5.347500 /
 * 4.210181, i.e. within 0.002° of the hand figures above. The verdicts are
 * identical under either model, which is the point of quoting both.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE CAVEAT THAT WAS, AND THE VERDICT THAT REPLACED IT
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This fixture originally refused to state a verdict for the near crest in
 * variant A, and said why: the near crest sits BELOW the skyline (4.554° <
 * 5.349°) and yet is in plain sight, because it stands in FRONT of the far
 * ridge and nothing closer blocks it. PLAN.md P1.5's rule as first written —
 * "visible iff the peak's angle clears the skyline at its bearing" — called it
 * hidden, which is wrong in the world, so ground truth withheld judgement
 * rather than bless the simplification.
 *
 * P1.5 has since been corrected: a peak is occluded only by terrain NEARER to
 * the observer than the peak itself. The verdict is therefore PROMOTED here to
 * a real expectation, and what has to be derived is one more angle per peak —
 * the highest angle reached by terrain strictly nearer than that peak.
 *
 * ── WHAT STANDS IN FRONT OF THE NEAR CREST (samples nearer than 5 000 m) ────
 * The plain is 1.6 m below the eye and negative at every range, so only the
 * near ridge's inner flank can compete. On that flank the angle climbs
 * monotonically (slope 401.6/1 000 = 0.4016 against tan α ≈ 0.08 — the same
 * 5× margin proven above), so the maximum is the LAST SAMPLE BEFORE the crest,
 * at 5 000 − 250 = 4 750 m:
 *
 *     E = 498.4 + 401.6 · (1 − 250/1 000) = 498.4 + 301.2 = 799.6 m
 *     c = 4 750² / 14 645 997.2414 = 22 562 500 / 14 645 997.2414 = 1.540523 m
 *     tan α = (799.6 − 500 − 1.540523) / 4 750 = 298.059477 / 4 750
 *           = 0.06274936
 *     α = 0.06274936 − 0.00008236 + 0.00000019 = 0.06266719 rad
 *       = 3.590565°        (exact sphere model: 3.590173°)
 *
 *     4.554485° − 3.590565° = +0.963920°  ⇒ THE NEAR CREST IS VISIBLE,
 *     in BOTH variants, since nothing about the far ridge is in front of it.
 *
 * ── WHAT STANDS IN FRONT OF THE FAR CREST (samples nearer than 20 000 m) ────
 * Variant A: the scan contains the near crest (4.554485°) and the far ridge's
 * own inner flank. The flank's last sample, 19 750 m, wins:
 *
 *     E = 498.4 + 1 901.6 · (1 − 250/2 000) = 498.4 + 1 663.9 = 2 162.3 m
 *     c = 19 750² / 14 645 997.2414 = 390 062 500 / 14 645 997.2414
 *       = 26.632703 m
 *     tan α = (2 162.3 − 500 − 26.632703) / 19 750 = 1 635.667297 / 19 750
 *           = 0.08281859
 *     α = 0.08281859 − 0.00018933 + 0.00000078 = 0.08263004 rad
 *       = 4.734353°        (exact sphere model: 4.732944°)
 *
 *     5.349262° − 4.734353° = +0.614909°  ⇒ FAR CREST VISIBLE (as before).
 *
 * Variant B: the far ridge is lower, so its flank at 19 750 m only reaches
 * 498.4 + 1 501.6 · 0.875 = 1 812.3 m, i.e.
 * tan α = (1 812.3 − 500 − 26.632703)/19 750 = 0.06509708 → 3.724533°, which
 * LOSES to the near crest's 4.554485°. The scan is therefore won by the near
 * crest — exactly the terrain that formed the skyline — so here the corrected
 * rule and the old one give the identical number:
 *
 *     4.211342° − 4.554485° = −0.343143°  ⇒ FAR CREST HIDDEN (as before).
 *
 * That is the backward-compatibility statement in miniature: for a peak beyond
 * everything that forms its skyline, nothing changes; only peaks with taller
 * terrain BEHIND them move, and they move from wrong to right.
 *
 * Note these three occluding angles depend on the declared 250 m sampling —
 * they are the angle of a specific sample, not of a continuum — which is why
 * `SAMPLING.rangeStepM` appears in the derivation. Any pipeline fed this
 * scene's samples sees precisely these values.
