/**
 * Elevation from LOCAL SRTM tiles — the offline replacement for the HTTP
 * elevation provider (PLAN.md P2.2 said OpenTopoData; this is the same seam).
 *
 * WHY LOCAL IS THE DEFAULT NOW.
 *   Mountain photographs are taken where there is no signal, so the product has
 *   to work from data already on the device. Practically, the JSON elevation and
 *   peak APIs are also unreachable from this environment. `.hgt` tiles turn
 *   elevation from a runtime dependency into an acquisition-time one:
 *   `npm run fetch:tiles` downloads squares of the world once, and the pipeline
 *   then runs with no network at all.
 *
 * THE SEAM. This class implements `ElevationProvider` from `elevation.ts`, so
 * anything that already takes an `ElevationProvider` accepts it unchanged. The
 * meaning of `elevationM: null` is identical in both: NO DATA HERE (ocean, void,
 * or — new for tiles — no tile downloaded for that square). It is never 0 m.
 *
 * `fetchElevations` flattens everything to `number | null` because that is the
 * shared contract. When you need to know WHY a point has no elevation — void vs.
 * missing tile vs. outside the grid — call `sampleTerrain`, which keeps the
 * distinction and also reports how the value was interpolated.
