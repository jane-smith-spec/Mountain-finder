/**
 * Terrain over HTTP — the browser's `TileStore` (TODO.md Q1).
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * HOW THE APP GETS TERRAIN, AND WHY THIS WAY
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * `DirectoryTileStore` reads `.hgt` files off a disk, which a browser does not
 * have. This store does the same job against a **same-origin static directory**
 * published by whoever serves the app: an index (`terrain-manifest.ts`) plus the
 * raw sample files it names.
 *
 * That keeps decision D7 intact in the browser:
 *
 *   • **No live third-party API at runtime.** The only requests are to the
 *     app's own origin for static files it shipped with. `npm run fetch:tiles`
 *     remains the one thing that talks to the outside world, at acquisition
 *     time, exactly as on the Node side.
 *   • **Cacheable and offline-able.** Static bytes under one path are what an
 *     HTTP cache — and later a service worker — can hold, so a photograph
 *     re-opened on a train is answered from the device.
 *   • **Honest about absence.** A coordinate the served directory does not
 *     cover produces `null`, never a substituted neighbour tile, and
 *     {@link HttpTerrainStore.coverage} answers *before* any download so the
 *     app can say WHICH tile is missing instead of drawing an empty overlay.
 *
 * The alternative — bundling one pre-baked window as an app asset — was
 * rejected as the primary mechanism: it makes the app work in exactly one
 * valley and silently useless everywhere else. It survives as a *special case*
 * of this design instead, because a window and a whole tile are both just grids
 * in the index, so an app can ship a small window AND serve whole tiles with no
 * second code path.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COSTS. A whole SRTM1 tile is 25 MB, and `selectTerrainGrid`
 * deliberately prefers the largest covering grid, so a full-tile deployment
 * pays 25 MB once per tile per session. That is the right trade: the small
 * window cannot see the ridge that hides a summit, and a cheap wrong answer is
 * the thing this project exists to avoid. The LRU keeps the parsed grids that
 * are actually in use and nothing more.
