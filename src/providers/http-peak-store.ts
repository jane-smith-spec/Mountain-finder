/**
 * Peaks over HTTP — the browser's `TiledPeakStore` loader (TODO.md Q8).
 *
 * The same shape as `HttpTerrainStore`, for the same reasons (decision D7):
 * the only requests are to the app's OWN origin for static files staged by
 * `npm run package:deploy` (or served by `scripts/peaks-server.ts` in dev) at
 * `/peaks/<region>/…` — no live peak API at runtime, cacheable, offline-able.
 *
 * WHAT IS FETCHED AND WHAT IS BUNDLED. The region INDEXES are compiled into
 * the JS bundle (src/app/data-credits.ts imports them for the attribution
 * footer — ~10 KB for five regions), so the app knows at build time which
 * regions exist and which cells each holds, and `TiledPeakStore` can prune to
 * the cells a query's bounding box touches before a single request leaves.
 * Only CELL FILES travel over HTTP, on demand: a Gornergrat query fetches
 * Zermatt's `N45E007.json` and nothing of California's 3 341 summits.
 *
 * WHY A MULTI-REGION SOURCE AND NOT ONE BIG STORE. Regions are imported,
 * shipped and credited independently (each index carries its own citations —
 * see P10.3), and their cell lists can overlap at the edges if two imports
 * ever cover adjacent ground. So each region keeps its own `TiledPeakStore`,
 * queries fan out to all of them — pruning makes the misses free — and the
 * results are de-duplicated by peak id, first region in sorted-name order
 * winning. Ids are Overture GERS ids, so the "duplicate" case is the same
 * physical summit imported twice, not two summits sharing a name.
