/**
 * Resolving where the observer stands.
 *
 * The eye's height above sea level is `groundElevationM + eyeHeightM`, and of
 * those two the camera height is the one a human can state ("about 1.6 m") while
 * the ground height is the one nobody knows. So the ground height is read off
 * the terrain, and THIS is the use of SRTM the data actually supports:
 *
 *   MISSION.md, verified 2026-08-16 — Zermatt village reads 1608 m, its true
 *   elevation, to the metre. Broad terrain and valley floors are trustworthy.
 *   Sharp summits are not (−248 m at the Matterhorn, and displaced ~320 m),
 *   which is why SUMMIT heights come from the peak database instead.
 *
 * A viewpoint on a knife-edge ridge is the one case where the observer lookup
 * inherits the summit problem — the Gornergrat platform is a ridge crest — so
 * a caller that has a surveyed figure should pass it and skip the lookup. The
 * result records which of the two happened.
