/**
 * Photo ingestion boundary: EXIF in, `Observer` + `CameraPose` out.
 *
 * Two steps, deliberately separate:
 *
 *   extractPhotoExif(photo)          what the file actually claims (P3.1)
 *   resolvePose(exif, overrides, …)  merged with user input, gaps named (P3.2)
 *
 * This is the only place magnetic bearings exist. Core receives true-north
 * headings or nothing at all.
