/**
 * WHAT THIS BUILD ACTUALLY SHIPS — the citations behind the footer.
 *
 * `attribution.ts` derives a credit from citation records; this module is where
 * those records come from, and it takes them from the shipped files themselves
 * rather than from a sentence somebody typed:
 *
 *   summits, labelled     fixtures/peaks/regions/<region>/ — the Overture
 *                         regions main.tsx reads through /peaks/ (Q8). The
 *                         INDEXES are matched by a glob so a region added
 *                         tomorrow appears in the footer with ITS licence, not
 *                         this one, and is served without a code change. They
 *                         carry Overture Maps' citation: © OpenStreetMap
 *                         contributors, ODbL-1.0 — attribution required.
 *   summits, cited        fixtures/peaks/ground-truth-peaks.json — the 15
 *                         cited summits the acceptance suite gates on, still
 *                         compiled into the bundle for this footer's count.
 *                         Its `sources[]` are per-summit citations
 *                         (Wikipedia / USGS GNIS); they name no licence, and
 *                         none is claimed for them.
 *   elevation             a citation constant, below, with its own reasons.
 *
 * Only the region INDEX files are imported (~10 KB of metadata for four
 * regions); the 3.2 MB of summit cells stay out of the bundle and are served
 * from `/peaks/` (docs/DEPLOY.md).
 *
 * ── THE ONE THING THAT CAN DRIFT ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * `peakDataReadByThisBuild` states which of the two summit datasets the
 * app actually reads. It is a claim about `main.tsx`, and switching that file
 * to the HTTP regions (TODO.md Q8) means changing this constant in the same
 * commit. It is a constant rather than a derivation because the alternative —
 * the footer quietly claiming whichever dataset is bigger — would be a guess.
 * Everything else here follows the data.
