/**
 * THE WIRING — app → pipeline → renderer (TODO.md Q1).
 *
 * `seam.ts` states what the app will call and what it expects back. This module
 * is the implementation of that contract, and it is the ONLY place where the
 * three halves of the system meet:
 *
 *     OverlayRequest (frame, observer, pose, showObscuredPeaks)
 *       → coverage check          src/providers/http-terrain-store
 *       → annotateScene           src/pipeline
 *       → layoutOverlay + SVG     src/render
 *       → OverlayResult (svgMarkup, peakNames, notes)
 *
 * It is pure in the sense that matters: every outside dependency — the terrain
 * source, the peak source, the tolerances — is injected, so this file is
 * exercised in `npm run check` against an analytic plane with no browser, no
 * server and no tiles, exactly as the pipeline is.
 *
 * ── WHY THE COVERAGE CHECK COMES FIRST ─────────────────────────────────────
 * A photograph taken where the app holds no elevation data must not produce an
 * empty overlay. An empty overlay reads as "no peaks are visible from here",
 * which is a claim, and it would be a fabricated one. So coverage is settled
 * BEFORE the pipeline runs, and its absence is raised as an error the UI shows
 * verbatim — naming the position, the tile that is missing and the command that
 * fetches it. That is the same discipline `src/exif/resolve.ts` applies to a
 * missing pose field: unknown is a state with a reason, never a zero.
