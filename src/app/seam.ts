/**
 * THE SEAM — where the app hands off to the pipeline and the renderer.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * P5.1 (this app) was built in parallel with P4 (renderer) and the pipeline, so
 * the component tree imports NOTHING from `src/render` or `src/pipeline`.
 * Instead it states, in types, exactly what it will call and exactly what it
 * expects back; both implementations arrive as props on `<App>`. That is still
 * true now that they exist, and it is worth keeping: the app can be rendered in
 * a test with no pipeline at all, and there is no hidden coupling anywhere
 * behind this line.
 *
 * ## What is on the other side of it (TODO.md Q1, done)
 *
 *   OverlayBuilder   src/app/overlay-builder.ts
 *                      observer + pose + frame
 *                        → coverage check          src/providers/http-terrain-store
 *                        → annotateScene           src/pipeline
 *                        → layoutOverlay + SVG     src/render
 *                        → { svgMarkup, peakNames, notes }
 *   PngExporter      src/app/composite-export.ts → src/render/composite.ts
 *
 * Both are constructed in `main.tsx`, which is the only file that knows about
 * all three layers at once.
 *
 * `OverlayRequest` deliberately carries the same things `OverlayScene`
 * (src/render/types.ts) needs minus `horizon` and `peaks`, which are precisely
 * what the pipeline computes: `widthPx`/`heightPx` are named identically, and
 * `pose` is a `CameraPose` from `src/core/types` with the trim ALREADY APPLIED.
 * Nothing is reshaped at the boundary.
 *
 * With no builder supplied the app still runs: the photo displays with an
 * obviously-labelled placeholder region, the effective pose is shown in full,
 * and the export button is disabled with the honest reason that there is
 * nothing to export. No stand-in peaks are ever drawn, because a plausible fake
 * summit is the one thing that could be mistaken for a working pipeline.
 *
 * A builder that CANNOT answer rejects, and the app shows the rejection
 * verbatim — see `noTerrainMessage`. Rejecting is not a failure of the seam; it
 * is the seam refusing to let "we have no data here" be drawn as "there is
 * nothing to see here".
