/**
 * The data contract for computer-vision skyline alignment (PLAN.md Phase 7).
 *
 * Naming follows `src/core/types.ts`, which is frozen: angles end in `Deg`,
 * heights in `M`, pixel quantities in `Px`. Two additions specific to this
 * module:
 *
 *   `…Norm`   a normalised image coordinate in [0,1], the same space
 *             `projectToImage` returns — x: 0 left, 1 right; y: 0 top, 1 bottom.
 *   `…01`     a unitless score clamped to [0,1].
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE HONESTY RULE THIS FILE ENFORCES IN THE TYPE SYSTEM
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The whole premise of this project is that it does not invent values. An
 * aligner that quietly returns `headingOffsetDeg: 0` when it failed is worse
 * than no aligner at all: it would leave every label exactly where the wrong
 * EXIF put it while claiming the photo had been checked. So the failure state
 * is a *different shape*, not a flag on the same shape — a caller that wants
 * `headingOffsetDeg` has to narrow the union first, and there is no member of
 * the failed variant that could be mistaken for an answer.
 */

 * A decoded image: 8-bit RGBA, row-major, top row first. Exactly the shape
 * `jpeg-js`'s `decode(bytes, { useTArray: true })` returns and exactly what
 * `CanvasRenderingContext2D.getImageData` returns, so neither a Node caller
 * nor a browser caller has to convert anything.
 *
 * `data.length` must be `width * height * 4`. Nothing in this module decodes
 * anything: `src/cv` is pixels in, numbers out (see README.md).
