/**
 * Public surface of the computer-vision skyline aligner (PLAN.md Phase 7).
 *
 * Everything exported here is a deterministic function of its arguments —
 * pixels in, numbers out. No network, no DOM, no filesystem, no clock, no
 * `Math.random`. The same rule `src/core` lives by, for the same reason: a
 * function that cannot be run in a test is a function nobody has run.
 *
 * Decoding a JPEG is deliberately NOT part of this module. The caller hands
 * over an {@link RgbaImage} — which is exactly what `jpeg-js` and
 * `getImageData` both produce — so the same code runs in Node and in the
 * browser with no branch and no image library in the dependency graph.
 *
 * NOT wired into the app. The seam is `src/pipeline/cv-alignment.ts`; see
 * `README.md` in this directory for what integrating it would take and what
 * would have to be true first.
