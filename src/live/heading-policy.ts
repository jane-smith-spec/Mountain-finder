/**
 * What to DRAW when the compass cannot give true north.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A WEAKENING OF THE MAGNETIC RULE
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * `sensors.ts` refuses a magnetic-only trace with `needs-declination`, and it
 * is right to: a magnetic bearing silently treated as true is worth 10–20° in
 * the mountains, and `src/exif/resolve.ts` refuses the same thing on the photo
 * path. The operative word in that rule has always been **silently**.
 *
 * The first mobile shell turned that refusal into "draw nothing", which is a
 * different and worse policy than the one D9 sets out. D9's whole finding is
 * that a label asserts a DIRECTION, not an identification, and that the right
 * answer to an uncertain pose is to draw the overlay, state the uncertainty,
 * and let the user drag it into place. Refusing to draw denies them the one
 * interaction that actually fixes the error — and it denies it hardest exactly
 * when the error is largest, which is backwards.
 *
 * So this module separates two questions that were wrongly fused:
 *
 *   "Is this heading TRUE?"          — the honesty question, still absolute
 *   "Is it good enough to draw?"     — the usefulness question
 *
 * A magnetic heading answers no to the first and yes to the second. It is
 * wrong by the local declination: a bounded, named, *systematic* quantity, not
 * an unknown one — under 5° across most of the contiguous US and Europe,
 * reaching ~25° in Alaska and worse at high latitudes. That is well inside the
 * ±30° heading trim the user already has, which is precisely what makes
 * dragging a fix rather than a workaround.
 *
 * What must never happen is the number reaching the user's eye *labelled* as
 * true north. Hence `basis`, which every caller has to look at to get the
 * heading out, and `caveat`, which is written for a screen rather than a log.
 *
 * Pure: samples in, decision out. No clock, no device, no I/O.
