/**
 * Dragging the overlay into place — the phone's version of the trim sliders.
 *
 * D9 is explicit about the interaction: *"we put our peaks overlay on screen
 * for them to scoot right or left as they wish to align."* On the web that is
 * three sliders (`src/app/trim.ts`); on a phone the natural gesture is to push
 * the overlay with a finger. This module is the geometry that connects the
 * two, so the phone produces the SAME `TrimState` the web app does and both
 * feed the same `applyTrim`.
 *
 * ── THE MISTAKE THIS MODULE WAS FIRST WRITTEN WITH ─────────────────────────
 * The obvious scale for a drag is `fovDeg / widthPx` — degrees per pixel. It
 * is wrong, and wrong in a way that hides on a narrow lens and becomes glaring
 * on a wide one, because a rectilinear projection is linear in the TANGENT of
 * the angle, not in the angle:
 *
 *     x = 0.5 + tan(B − heading) / (2 · tan(hFov/2))
 *
 * A portrait phone frame has a vertical field of view around 108°, where
 * `fov/px` under-reads the true scale by 46 %: the overlay lags the finger by
 * almost half. Inverting the equation properly costs one `atan`:
 *
 *     angle = atan( (dPx / extentPx) · 2 · tan(fov/2) )
 *
 * which is EXACT for a drag measured from the centre of frame, and is what
 * `dragAngleDeg` computes. The round-trip is asserted through the real
 * `projectToImage` in the tests rather than trusted to this comment.
 *
 * The signs follow from the same equation. Pushing the overlay RIGHT by `dx`
 * *decreases* the heading — the feature moves right because the camera is
 * treated as pointing further left. Dragging DOWN increases pitch, because
 * tilting a camera up moves the world down the frame.
 *
 * Pure: pixels in, degrees out. Both `src/core`'s rules and D9's discipline —
 * the drag writes the SAME visible trim state the sliders do, never a hidden
 * correction applied behind the user's back.
