/**
 * The live overlay loop — Phase 8's P8.3, the pure half.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE ONE FACT THE LOOP IS BUILT ON
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * Every verdict in an `AnnotatedScene` is POSE-FREE. Visibility is a fact
 * about the terrain and the peaks — a summit clears the ground in front of it
 * or it does not, whichever way the camera happens to point — and the sweep,
 * the horizon profile and every clearance were computed without consulting
 * `camera` at all (the pose only projects the results into the frame). So a
 * live view does NOT re-run the pipeline per frame: it computes the scene
 * once and re-projects it as the sensors move the pose, which is the entire
 * still pipeline minus the two expensive steps (terrain sweep, peak query).
 *
 * The one thing the pose CAN invalidate is coverage: the still pipeline
 * sweeps a bounded sector around the initial heading (2× the field of view in
 * the app), and a user who turns far enough points the camera at bearings
 * whose terrain was never swept — where peaks were refused as `unmeasured`
 * (R-1) and where the drawn horizon line would be interpolated across the
 * un-swept arc. That is not a rendering problem, it is missing evidence, so
 * this module REFUSES those frames with `resweep-needed` and the caller runs
 * the pipeline again around the new heading — exactly what the still path
 * does for a new photograph. Refusing is cheap (the check is arithmetic);
 * showing labels over never-swept terrain would be the fabrication this
 * repository exists to prevent.
 *
 * Pure throughout: scene in, overlay scene or refusal out. The React Native
 * shell's render loop calls `liveOverlayScene` per sensor tick and
 * `layoutOverlay` (src/render) on the result, both side-effect-free.
