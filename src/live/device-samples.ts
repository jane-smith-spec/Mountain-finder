/**
 * Expo sensor payloads → this project's `GravitySample` / `HeadingSample`.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * `src/live/sensors.ts` consumes a clean, documented convention: gravity as
 * the direction of DOWN in device coordinates, unit magnitude, timestamps in
 * epoch-ish milliseconds. Expo hands out something else entirely — m/s², a
 * *derived* gravity channel that does not exist as a field, timestamps in
 * seconds on a different clock, and a compass "accuracy" that is a 0–3 bucket
 * rather than degrees.
 *
 * Every one of those is a place where a plausible wrong number gets through.
 * So the conversion lives here, pure and tested, instead of being scattered
 * through a React Native component where nothing can check it.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS VERIFIED, AND HOW (2026-08-18) ────────────────────────────────
 * Not from the docs (blocked at this environment's egress) and not from
 * memory. From the native source that ships inside `expo-sensors@57.0.2`,
 * quoted here so a later reader can re-check the claim without a phone:
 *
 *   iOS — ios/DeviceMotionModule.swift:
 *     "acceleration":                    userAcceleration * GRAVITY
 *     "accelerationIncludingGravity":   (userAcceleration + data.gravity) * GRAVITY
 *
 *   Android — DeviceMotionModule.kt:
 *     "acceleration":                    TYPE_LINEAR_ACCELERATION
 *     "accelerationIncludingGravity":    TYPE_ACCELEROMETER − 2 × TYPE_GRAVITY
 *
 * Subtracting gives the SAME vector on both platforms:
 *
 *   iOS      (uA + g)·G − uA·G                     = g·G
 *   Android  (LA + G_up) − 2·G_up − LA             = −G_up = G_down
 *
 * where CoreMotion's `data.gravity` and Android's negated `TYPE_GRAVITY` are
 * both the direction of DOWN. Dividing by 9.80665 yields exactly the unit
 * vector `GravitySample` documents — **with no sign flip**.
 *
 * That last clause is the point of doing this properly. The W3C DeviceMotion
 * spec defines `accelerationIncludingGravity` as the *specific force*, which
 * points UP for a resting device — the opposite sign. Expo's iOS module does
 * not follow the spec here, and Android's `− 2 × gravity` term exists solely
 * to bend the platform into iOS's convention. Anyone reasoning from the W3C
 * definition (as I was about to) gets a pitch that is correct in magnitude and
 * inverted in sign — which passes a smoke test, looks like a plausible
 * mountain overlay, and is wrong. `docs/FINDINGS.md` carries this as X-7.
 *
 * ── THE TWO CLOCKS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * DeviceMotion timestamps are **seconds since device boot** (iOS:
 * `CMDeviceMotion.timestamp`; Android: `SensorEvent.timestamp / 1e9`).
 * `LocationHeadingObject` carries **no timestamp at all**. Since
 * `fuseSensorPose` compares both traces against one `atMs`, feeding it two
 * different clock origins would silently mark one trace permanently stale.
 *
 * So both adapters stamp samples with a caller-supplied `receivedAtMs` — one
 * clock, chosen by the shell — and the device's own timestamp is preserved
 * separately as `deviceTimestampMs` for jitter diagnostics. At the 60 Hz these
 * sensors run, arrival time and sample time differ by well under a frame,
 * which is far below the smoothing time constant (400 ms).
 *
 * Pure, per `src/core`'s rules: no clock is read here, no Expo module is
 * imported. The payload types below are structural mirrors of Expo's, so this
 * file compiles and tests in this environment with no mobile toolchain.
