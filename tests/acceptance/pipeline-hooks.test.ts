/**
 * ACCEPTANCE — PIPELINE HOOKS (PLAN.md P6.3)
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS NOW
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * The hooks are switched on. Every assertion below runs the REAL pipeline
 * (`src/pipeline`) against the fixtures' independent yardstick, offline:
 *
 *   synthetic scenes  the scene's own generator produces `ElevationSample[]`;
 *                     the pipeline samples that cloud along its own rays and
 *                     must reproduce the closed forms derived in the scene
 *                     module, which never imports src/core.
 *   real viewpoints   terrain comes from `fixtures/tiles/cases/` — rectangles
 *                     cut byte-for-byte out of real SRTM1 tiles and committed,
 *                     so nothing here depends on `data/tiles/` (gitignored).
 *                     Peaks come from `fixtures/peaks/`, whose coordinates and
 *                     heights were copied from these very case files.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE CONFIDENCE POLICY, UNCHANGED
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   confidence 'high'      HARD GATE. A failure fails the build.
 *   confidence 'medium'    REPORT ONLY. Printed loudly; never fails the build,
 *                          because the uncertainty is in the ground truth.
 *   `disputed`             INFORMATIONAL. The verdict is printed so a human can
 *                          weigh in. Never asserted, never promoted.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT SATISFIES A CLAIM, AFTER DECISION D8
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A must-see peak is satisfied by being LABELLED — `visible`, or
 * `self-occluded` and therefore drawn greyed. A must-NOT-see peak must be
 * absent from the overlay altogether: classified `foreground-occluded` and
 * missing from `scene.labelled`. That is strictly STRONGER than the old
 * "not visible" gate, which a greyed label would now satisfy, so the two halves
 * of D8 move in opposite directions on purpose.
 *
 * No expectation in tests/acceptance/cases was weakened to make anything pass.
 * Where the pipeline contradicts a 'high' claim the assertion is left failing
 * and the finding is written up — that is the outcome this suite exists to
 * produce.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT A LIMITED TERRAIN WINDOW CAN AND CANNOT PROVE
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The committed windows are sized to what each case's verdicts turn on (see
 * `CASE_TERRAIN` in src/pipeline/testing/case-terrain.ts). A window that stops
 * at 3 km can produce a FALSE VISIBLE — terrain that would block sits outside
 * it — but never a false hidden. So the must-NOT-see gates are covered in full,
 * while a must-see verdict on a 100 km sightline means only "nothing inside the
 * window hides it". Each case prints its own `coverageNote` alongside the
 * verdicts rather than letting a reader assume more than was tested.

          //     the requested step, so the two differ in the last few bits and

          //     counts, the reported occluding angle becomes the peak's OWN
          //     angle and the clearance collapses to ~0. The VERDICT is
          //     unaffected (an equal angle still clears), which is why the

          //     this exact coincidence, and that is worth knowing.

/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * D8 — the three real cases the self-occlusion rule is pinned by
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The rule itself is argued from geometry and unit-tested on hand-built
 * terrain in src/core/visibility.test.ts. These three are the REAL cases it has
 * to get right, asserted by name so that a future change to the rule cannot
 * quietly re-classify them:
 *
 *   Cow Hill      SELF-occluded. Standing in Fort William at the foot of the
 *                 hill, its own shoulder at 0.84 km hides the summit posting at
 *                 0.99 km. The ground climbs from the shoulder to the summit
 *                 without once dropping back, so there is no col and one
 *                 landform. Labelled, greyed.
 *   Ben Nevis     FOREGROUND. Hidden by Cow Hill's lower flank at 0.63 km,
 *                 with Glen Nevis — over a hundred metres below that flank —
 *                 in between. Two landforms. Not labelled.
 *   Mount Baker   FOREGROUND. 134 km away behind Queen Anne Hill. Not labelled.
 *
 * The col depths are NOT asserted to particular metre values here: they are
 * readings of the committed DEM, not independent ground truth, and pinning them
 * would be pinning the tiles rather than the rule. What is asserted is the
 * classification, its evidence, and the SIGN of the discriminating quantity —
 * zero col for the shoulder, a col deeper than the whole obstruction for the
 * other two.
