/**
 * The real-world ground-truth cases (PLAN.md P6.2).
 *
 * Four viewpoints, chosen so that between them they stress different parts of
 * the pipeline rather than four times the same part:
 *
 *   gornergrat         short range, high angles — geodesy and sign conventions
 *   mount-diablo       very long range, all NEGATIVE angles — curvature and k
 *   kerry-park-seattle near-field occlusion with a 6 deg margin — the easy block
 *   fort-william       near-field occlusion with a 1 deg margin — the hard block
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * AND, SEPARATELY, THE PHOTO CASES
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `photoCases` holds the two supplied Idaho photographs. They are a DIFFERENT
 * type — `PhotoCase`, not `GroundTruthCase` — because neither has a measured
 * view bearing and neither has a confirmed list of summits in frame, and
 * `GroundTruthCase` requires both (`view.bearingDeg: number`, and a non-empty
 * `mustBeVisible` that the suite gates on). They assert position, elevation,
 * terrain coverage and peak-dataset coverage; visibility is recorded as
 * unverified and asserted in NEITHER direction. See photo-case-types.ts.
 *
 * Keeping them out of `groundTruthCases` is deliberate: every gate that applies
 * to the four viewpoints above still applies to exactly those four, unweakened.
