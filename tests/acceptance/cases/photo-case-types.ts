/**
 * Schema for the PHOTO ground-truth cases — a real photograph, a real
 * position, and NO view bearing.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE TYPE FROM `GroundTruthCase`
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `GroundTruthCase` is built around a claim of the form "from here, that peak
 * is / is not visible", and its schema makes two things mandatory that neither
 * of the supplied Idaho photographs can honestly supply:
 *
 *   1. `view.bearingDeg: number`. Both photographs FIRST arrived with their EXIF
 *      stripped — orientation and pixel dimensions survived, GPS and
 *      `GPSImgDirection` did not (asserted in photo-cases.test.ts, from the
 *      committed files themselves). Any number written in that field would have
 *      been invented, and an invented bearing is exactly the failure mode this
 *      repository keeps designing against.
 *
 *      **Half of that is now fixed, by evidence rather than by relaxing the
 *      rule.** The photographer later supplied the camera ORIGINALS, whose EXIF
 *      survived intact, and the Railroad Ridge frame carries `GPSImgDirection
 *      174.089° T`. So that case's view is a {@link MeasuredView} read out of
 *      committed bytes; the Sunset Mountain lookout frame has no original and
 *      remains an {@link UnmeasuredView}. The schema now expresses both, and
 *      which one a case is remains a change to this file to make.
 *   2. `mustBeVisible` with at least one peak. Nobody has established which
 *      summits are in either frame. Deriving a must-see list from the geometry
 *      would make the pipeline its own ground truth — CLAUDE.md rule 4 — and a
 *      case that asserts what the code computes tests nothing.
 *
 * So a photo case asserts only what is independently checkable today:
 *
 *   ASSERTED    the position, its elevation, and the agreement between
 *               independently sourced elevations for it; that the committed
 *               terrain window contains the viewpoint and the whole declared
 *               sweep; that the peak dataset covers the query radius; that the
 *               named summits really are in that dataset where this file says.
 *   RECORDED    which summits stand near the viewpoint, and the fact that
 *               whether any of them is in the frame is UNKNOWN. Recorded in the
 *               same spirit as `DisputedExpectation` in case-types.ts: reported,
 *               never asserted, in neither direction.
 *
 * A photo case is therefore not a weaker ground-truth case. It is a different
 * claim: everything except the frame.
