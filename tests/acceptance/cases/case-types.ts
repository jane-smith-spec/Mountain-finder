/**
 * Schema for the real-world ground-truth acceptance cases (PLAN.md P6.2).
 *
 * These files live under tests/acceptance/ rather than fixtures/ because they
 * are pure text — coordinates, citations and expected peak names. No binaries
 * are committed: PLAN.md and the task brief both forbid dragging large photos
 * into the repository, so where an openly licensed photograph exists we record
 * its URL and licence and leave the bytes on the internet.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE HONESTY RULES THIS SCHEMA ENFORCES
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 1. Every number carries a source. `sources[]` is not optional decoration.
 * 2. Every visibility claim carries an `evidence` list and a `confidence`.
 *    A claim I could not establish does not go in `mustBeVisible` or
 *    `mustNotBeVisible` — it goes in `disputed`, which the suite reports but
 *    never fails on.
 * 3. `confidence: 'high'` means the claim is a hard gate. `'medium'` means it
 *    is worth testing but a failure is a prompt to investigate, not proof of a
 *    bug. The acceptance suite must treat the two differently.
 *
 * Angle and height naming follows src/core/types.ts: `elevationM` is a height
 * in metres, `bearingDeg` is a true-north compass angle.
