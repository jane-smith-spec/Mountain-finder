/**
 * PHOTO CASE — RAILROAD RIDGE ROAD, WHITE CLOUD MOUNTAINS, IDAHO
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * Photograph: `fixtures/photos/real/tundra-blue-sky.jpeg`, supplied 2026-08-17.
 * Broad tundra foreground, a jagged rock skyline, snowfield against bright
 * cloud on the left and dark rock against blue sky on the right.
 *
 * This is the strong half of the pair. The skyline extractor resolves 506 of
 * 512 columns on it (98.8 % coverage, mean confidence 0.575), so it is the one
 * photograph in this repository on which recovering a heading from terrain is a
 * realistic prospect. It still has no heading today, and this file asserts
 * nothing that would need one.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT IS ESTABLISHED, AND HOW
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *     Photographer   44°08'20.4"N 114°35'44.5"W  =  44.13900, −114.59569
 *     SRTM N44W115 at that point                    3166.1 m = 10,387 ft
 *     Published Railroad Ridge crest                10,433 ft = 3180 m
 *
 * The middle line is a reading of the same radar data the committed window
 * holds, so it is a FIXTURE-INTEGRITY check and is labelled as one. The third
 * is the independent one: a published elevation for the ridge this road runs
 * along, 14 m above the DEM at the supplied point — which is what a point ON a
 * ridge road should read against the ridge's own high point. A coordinate typed
 * wrong by a digit lands in a valley and misses by hundreds of metres.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE VIEW BEARING — MEASURED 2026-08-17, AND WHERE IT CAME FROM
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Until 2026-08-17 this block read "NOT ESTABLISHED", because the committed
 * JPEG carries orientation and dimensions and nothing else. That was a true
 * statement about the FILE and a false one about the photograph: the JPEG is a
 * transcode whose share path dropped the whole GPS IFD.
 *
 * The photographer then supplied the camera original,
 * `fixtures/photos/real/railroad-ridge-48mm.heic`, and its EXIF is intact:
 *
 *     GPSImgDirection      174.08944701476096, GPSImgDirectionRef 'T'
 *     GPSLatitude/Longitude    44.139125 N, 114.595650 W
 *     GPSAltitude              3165.65 m  (SRTM reads 3166.1 m here — 0.4 m)
 *     FocalLengthIn35mmFormat  48 mm   ->  hFOV 41.11 deg, vFOV 31.42 deg
 *
 * That the original is the SAME PICTURE as the committed JPEG is not assumed.
 * Both decode to 4032 x 3024, and comparing them pixel for pixel gives a mean
 * |dRGB| of 1.03/255 with a maximum of 18 — the residue of a JPEG transcode
 * and a Display-P3 profile, not two different photographs.
 *
 * The heading is a phone magnetometer reading. It is TRUE-referenced (ref 'T',
 * so declination is already applied) and it is NOT of survey quality; no
 * uncertainty is stated because none is published, and inventing +-10 deg
 * because it sounds like the right order of magnitude is the same sin as
 * inventing the bearing was. What IS recorded, as corroboration and nothing
 * more, is that this repository's own aligner — given the correct lens and a
 * +-25 deg window — independently returns 174.893 deg from the terrain, 0.804
 * deg away. Two unrelated instruments agreeing to under a degree is the
 * strongest statement available here, and it is still not an error bar.
 *
 * AND ONE THING EXIF DOES NOT CARRY AT ALL: PITCH. Every run assumes zero, and
 * on this photograph zero is wrong by 3.52 deg — the camera was pointed down,
 * which is why the frame is half tundra. That is the largest single error in
 * the first annotated render, larger than either heading estimate's. It is not
 * recorded in `view` because `view` is about where the camera POINTED in
 * bearing; it is recorded here so nobody reads the measured heading as though
 * it settled the pose.
 *
 * ONE CONSEQUENCE WORTH STATING PLAINLY: every alignment run before this date
 * assumed a 26 mm-equivalent lens, hFOV 69.4 deg, because the stripped JPEG
 * named no focal length. The true frame is 41.1 deg — a 1.69x error in image
 * scale. Sweeping the whole compass in 24 windows under the wrong lens produces
 * an answer in NONE of them; under the right lens the window containing the
 * truth is the only one that both survives its gates and holds the lowest
 * residual of all 24 (1.112 deg). The aligner was not the thing that was wrong.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT IS STILL NOT ESTABLISHED — AND IS THEREFORE ASSERTED NOWHERE
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * • WHICH SUMMITS ARE IN THE FRAME. Seventeen named summits stand within the
 *   7.5 km window and thirty-two within 25 km; several of them are within a few
 *   degrees of one another from here. Picking the ones the pipeline would
 *   compute and calling them ground truth is precisely the circularity
 *   CLAUDE.md rule 4 forbids.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ONE MEASURED FACT ABOUT THE COMMITTED WINDOW
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The window's highest sample is 3503 m at 44.11833 N, 114.62083 W — 268 m east
 * of the Calkens Peak node, whose tagged height is 3509 m. So SRTM under-reads
 * this summit by 6 m AND displaces its maximum by a quarter of a kilometre,
 * which is the behaviour MISSION.md documents for sharp tops and the reason
 * summit heights in this case come from the peak dataset and never from these
 * bytes. Recorded as a DEM reading; it gates nothing.
