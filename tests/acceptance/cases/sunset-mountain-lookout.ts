/**
 * PHOTO CASE — SUNSET MOUNTAIN LOOKOUT, BOISE MOUNTAINS, IDAHO
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * Photograph: `fixtures/photos/real/lookout-snow-haze.jpeg`, supplied
 * 2026-08-17. Snow, white haze, and a lookout's window frame across the left
 * quarter of the image.
 *
 * This is the first case in the set built around a REAL photograph rather than
 * a viewpoint someone else wrote about, and it is deliberately the weaker of
 * the two: the skyline extractor reads it at 1.4 % coverage and says so (see
 * docs/CV-REAL-PHOTO-FINDING.md, owned elsewhere). Nothing in this file depends
 * on the extractor, because nothing in this file makes a claim about the frame.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT IS ESTABLISHED, AND HOW
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The position is not a guess and not read off a map by eye. `Sunset Mountain`
 * is a summit node in the Overture/OSM import committed at
 * `fixtures/peaks/regions/idaho-central/`, and SRTM agrees with its tagged
 * height at its own coordinate:
 *
 *     Overture / OSM summit node   43.89851 N, 115.64677 W   2393 m (ele tag)
 *     SRTM N43W116, same point                               2392.296 m
 *     National Historic Lookout Register                     7,869 ft = 2398.5 m
 *
 * Two of those three are wholly independent of each other — an OSM tag and a
 * radar DEM — and they agree to 0.7 m. The third, a register of lookout
 * structures, sits 6 m above both, which is the ordinary disagreement between a
 * structure's quoted elevation and the ground under it.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT IS NOT ESTABLISHED — AND IS THEREFORE ASSERTED NOWHERE
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * • THE VIEW BEARING. The file's EXIF carries orientation and pixel dimensions
 *   and nothing else: no GPS, no `GPSImgDirection`, no focal length. That is
 *   asserted from the committed bytes in photo-cases.test.ts, so "unmeasured"
 *   is a checked fact here, not a note. `view.bearingDeg` is `null` and the
 *   type will not accept a number.
 * • WHICH SUMMITS ARE IN THE FRAME. Nobody has established one. The nearest
 *   named summit other than the observer's own is 7.6 km away, so this
 *   photograph may well contain no named summit at all — which is precisely why
 *   guessing a must-see list from geometry would be inventing ground truth.
 * • THE CAMERA'S HEIGHT ABOVE THE GROUND. The lookout is an R-6 cab on a 10-foot
 *   concrete base with a walk-around catwalk, so a photograph taken from the
 *   catwalk sits about 3 m higher than one taken standing on the summit. The
 *   case records 1.6 m and says so; no assertion here is sensitive to it.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ONE MEASURED FACT ABOUT THE COMMITTED WINDOW, WORTH KNOWING EARLY
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The 6 km window's highest sample is 2471 m, at 43.95222 N, 115.7075 W — about
 * 78 m ABOVE the lookout, in the box's north-west corner. So the lookout is not
 * the local high point in every direction, and whoever eventually recovers a
 * bearing for this photograph should not assume a clean horizon to the
 * north-west. Recorded as a reading of the DEM, gating nothing.
