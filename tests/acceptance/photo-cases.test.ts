/**
 * ACCEPTANCE — THE SUPPLIED PHOTOGRAPHS (photo cases)
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Two real photographs with real positions, ONE of which now has a measured
 * view bearing. What this file proves, offline, from committed bytes:
 *
 *   1. The photographs are what the cases say they are — dimensions,
 *      orientation, and the ABSENCE of GPS and of `GPSImgDirection` in the
 *      committed JPEGs. That last one is the load-bearing assertion of this
 *      file: it turns "this file carries no bearing" from a claim in a comment
 *      into a checked property of the bytes, so nobody can fill in a plausible
 *      number and leave the prose saying otherwise.
 *
 *      **And its mirror image, added 2026-08-17.** The Railroad Ridge case now
 *      commits the CAMERA ORIGINAL alongside the transcode, and its heading is
 *      re-read from that original's EXIF rather than trusted from the data
 *      file. The absence check and the presence check are the same check run in
 *      opposite directions: a stripped file may not claim a heading, and a case
 *      that claims one must point at bytes that carry it. Note in particular
 *      that the ORIGINAL is asserted to carry every field the transcode is
 *      asserted to lack — swap a stripped file in as the "original" and this
 *      fails rather than passing vacuously.
 *   2. Every number traces to a source, and every source resolves — a URL for
 *      the remote ones, an existing file for the committed ones.
 *   3. The committed SRTM window contains the viewpoint AND the whole sweep it
 *      declares (checked at 72 bearings on the sweep's own outer radius), and
 *      the elevation it reads at the observer agrees with each independently
 *      cited figure within that figure's stated tolerance.
 *   4. The imported peak region really covers the radius each case queries —
 *      asked of `TiledPeakStore.coverageFor`, which answers from the index
 *      before a single cell is read — and the summits each case names are in
 *      that dataset, by id, at the stated coordinates and heights.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It runs no pipeline and asserts no visibility. Neither photograph has a
 * confirmed list of summits in frame, and a must-see list derived from the same
 * geometry the pipeline uses would be the pipeline grading its own homework
 * (CLAUDE.md rule 4). The recorded summits are printed at the end of the run,
 * with the reason each is unresolved, and asserted in neither direction — the
 * treatment `disputed` gets in ground-truth-cases.test.ts.
 *
 * The four `GroundTruthCase`s and every gate on them are untouched by this
 * file; the photo cases are a separate list of a separate type.
